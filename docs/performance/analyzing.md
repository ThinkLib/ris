# Analyzing the Bundle Size

If you want to analyze the build performance of the project, ris provide `analyze` script to create `stats.json`. And then we can analyze the build preformance through some tools such as [webpack-analyse](http://webpack.github.io/analyse/)„ÄÅ[webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/th0r/webpack-bundle-analyzer) and [webpack-chart](http://alexkuz.github.io/webpack-chart/).

In the project root folder, we excute:

```bash
npm run analyze
```
