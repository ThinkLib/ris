# Introduction

RIS, React Integrated Solution. RIS's target is to provide a basic build solution that high scalability. Through this toolset we focus on output some best practice about react.

Create this tools, something is referenced [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). I learned a lot from them. Here I suggest you to learn about them in deep.

In fact, there are many similar tools or framworks to to this. There are two reasons for me to do it. First, I want to learn how to create front-end integrated Solution. Second, I know I can make something different and innovate.
